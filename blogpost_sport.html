        <p class="font1">has withdrawn from the July 23-Aug. 8 Tokyo Olympics after picking up a knee injury during the grasscourt season, the Swiss said on Tuesday.Federer, who turns 40 next month, had two knee surgeries in 2020 which resulted in more than a year of
            rehabilitation. He withdrew from the French Open after winning his third round match to save himself for the grasscourt season. He was beaten in the quarter-final at Wimbledon.</p>

        <p class="font1">During the grass court season, I unfortunately experienced a setback with my knee, and have accepted that I must withdraw from the Tokyo Olympic Games," Federer said on Twitter. "I am greatly disappointed, as it has been an honour and highlight
            of my career each time I have represented Switzerland. "I have already begun rehabilitation in the hopes of returning to the tour later this summer. I wish the entire Swiss team the best of luck and I will be rooting hard from afar." </p>
        <p class="font1"> Already as popular as Santa Claus, Roger Federer is now benefiting from the extra wave of emotion that rewards great athletes in their final act. A thrilling five set victory over historical rival Rafael Nadal in the recent Australian Open final
            has shown that there’s life in the old dog yet. Already feted at one of the sport’s greatest ever players this last trophy could well have cemented his place at the pinnacle. How, then, does he do it? In his interview with Life Beyond Sport,
            Federer highlights the areas that have helped him stay competitive and fight “My coach wanted me more to play more matches and play tournaments more consistently,” said Federer. “I used to go in spells, but he doesn’t believe in taking too
            long of a break. He says it’s fine to do that when you’re younger, but when you’re older, maybe it’s easier for your body to keep on playing. “We took a similar approach in training. He reminded me to keep on playing points, whereas before
            I would only do that when the next tournament was close. I think it actually helped me to remain in a good rhythm. When you take a direction like that, you’ve got to stick with it and see if it works out. For me it did, because I’ve had no
            recurring issues any more with my back.” </p>
