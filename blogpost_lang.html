        <p class="font1">High-level programming language includes Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language. Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) language is derived from structured programming
            and based upon the procedure call concept.

        <p class="font1">What is Language? Language is a mode of communication that is used to share ideas, opinions with each other. For example, if we want to teach someone, we need a language that is understandable by both communicators.

            <b>What is a Programming Language?</b> A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python)
            to perform a specific task. A programming language is mainly used to develop desktop applications, websites, and mobile applications.</p>

        <p class="font1"><b>Types of programming language</b>

            <p class="font1"><b>1. Low-level programming language</b> Low-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level
                language can be run very fast. Low-level language is further divided into two parts -</p>

            <p class="font1"><b>i. Machine Language</b> Machine language is a type of low-level programming language. It is also called as machine code or object code. Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form (base
                16) form. It does not require a translator to convert the programs because computers directly understand the machine language programs. The advantage of machine language is that it helps the programmer to execute the programs faster than
                the high-level programming language.</p>

            <p class="font1"><b>ii. Assembly Language</b> Assembly language (ASM) is also a type of low-level programming language that is designed for specific processors. It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human-understandable form. It uses an assembler
                to convert the assembly language to machine language. The advantage of assembly language is that it requires less memory and less execution time to execute a program.</p>

            <p class="font1"><b>2. High-level programming language</b> High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program
                into machine language (execute the program). The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain. High-level programming language includes Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol,
                Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language.</p>
            <p class="font1"><b>A high-level language is further divided into two parts -</b> </p>
            <p class="font1"><b>i. Procedural Oriented programming language</b></p>
            <p class="font1">Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) language is derived from structured programming and based upon the procedure call concept. It divides a program into small procedures called routines or functions. Procedural Oriented programming language
                is used by a software programmer to create a program that can be accomplished by using a programming editor like IDE, Adobe Dreamweaver, or Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>

            <p class="font1"><b>ii. Object-Oriented Programming language</b> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language is based upon the objects. In this programming language, programs are divided into small parts called objects. It is used to implement real-world entities
                like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc in the program to makes the program resusable, efficient, and easy-to-use. The main advantage of object-oriented programming is that OOP is faster and easier to execute, maintain, modify,
                as well as debug.

                <p class="font1">Note: Object-Oriented Programming language follows a bottom-up approach.</p>

                <p class="font1">Example: C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.</p>
