        <p class="font1">5G is the 5th generation of mobile networks, a significant evolution of todays 4G LTE networks.  5G has been designed to meet the very large growth in data and connectivity of today’s modern society, the internet of things with billions of connected
            devices, and tomorrow’s innovations. 5G will initially operate in conjunction with existing 4G networks before evolving to fully standalone networks in subsequent releases and coverage expansions
        </p>
        <p class="font1">In addition to delivering faster connections and greater capacity, a very important advantage of 5G is the fast response time referred to as latency. Latency is the time taken for devices to respond to each other over the wireless network. 3G
            networks had a typical response time of 100 milliseconds, 4G is around 30 milliseconds and 5G will be as low as  1 millisecond. This is virtually instantaneous opening up a new world of connected applications.</p>
        <p class="font1"><b>How Does 5G Work?</b> Wireless communications systems use radio frequencies (also known as spectrum) to carry information through the air. 5G operates in the same way, but uses higher radio frequencies that are less cluttered. This allows for
            it to carry more information at a much faster rate. These higher bands are called 'millimeter waves' (mmwaves). They were previously unused but have been opened up for licensing by regulators. They had been largely untouched by the public
            as the equipment to use them was largely inaccessible and expensive. While higher bands are faster at carrying information, there can be problems with sending over large distances. They are easily blocked by physical objects such as trees
            and buildings. In order to circumvent this challenge, 5G will utilise multiple input and output antennae to boost signals and capacity across the wireless network. The technology will also use smaller transmitters. Placed on buildings and
            street furniture, as opposed to using single stand-alone masts. Current estimates say that 5G will be able to support up to 1,000 more devices per metre than 4G. 5G technology will also be able to ‘slice’ a physical network into multiple virtual
            networks. This means that operators will be able to deliver the right slice of network, depending on how it is being used, and thereby better manage their networks. This means, for example, that an operator will be able use different slice
            capacities depending on importance. So, a single user streaming a video would use a different slice to a business, while simpler devices could be separated from more complex and demanding applications, such as controlling autonomous vehicles.
            There are also plans to allow businesses to rent their own isolated and insulated network slice in order to separate them from competing Internet traffic.</p>
        <p class="font1"><b>How Much Faster is 5G Compared to 4G and 3G?</b> Should 5G achieve the expected data speeds of 10 Gps, this will be 100 times faster than standard 4G. It will also be 30 times faster than advanced 4G standards such as LTE-A. However, even with
            more conservative estimates, it will easily outpace both 3G and 4G. 3G has average download speeds of 8Mbps and a maximum of 384Kbps, 4G has a 32.5MBps average download speed and a maximum of 100Mbps. 4G+ has a 42Mbps average and a maximum
            download speed of 300Mbps. While 5G, by comparison, has an average download speed of 130-240Mbps and a theoretical maximum of 1-10Gbps. This means, for example, that it would take between 4 and 40 seconds to download a full HD film on 5G,
            as compared to over 7 minutes on 4G and over a day with 3G</p>
